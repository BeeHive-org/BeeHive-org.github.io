Using these two, digital electronic systems are able to store, process, and transmit data or information. The strength of a signal is typically described by its voltage level. How is a logic 0 (LOW) or a logic 1 (HIGH) defined? Manufacturers of chips generally define these in their spec sheets.

TTL is an acronym for Transistor-Transistor Logic. It relies on circuits built from bipolar transistors to achieve switching and maintain logic states. Transistors are basically fancy-speak for electrically controlled switches. For any logic family, there are a number of threshold voltage levels to know. Below is an example for standard 5V TTL levels:</p> <p>VOH -- Minimum OUTPUT Voltage level a TTL device will provide for a HIGH signal.</p> <p>VIH -- Minimum INPUT Voltage level to be considered a HIGH.</p> <p>VOL -- Maximum OUTPUT Voltage level a device will provide for a LOW signal.</p> <p>VIL -- Maximum INPUT Voltage level to still be considered a LOW.</p> <p></p> <p>You will notice that the minimum output HIGH voltage (VOH) is 2.7 V. Basically, this means that output voltage of the device driving HIGH will always be at least 2.7 V. The minimum input HIGH voltage (VIH) is 2 V, or basically any voltage that is at least 2 V will be read in as a logic 1 (HIGH) to a TTL device.</p> <p>You will also notice that there is a cushion of 0.7 V between the output of one device and the input of another. This is sometimes referred to as noise margin.</p> <p>Likewise, the maximum output LOW voltage (VOL) is 0.4 V. This means that a device trying to send out a logic 0 will always be below 0.4 V.

Well, your guess is as good as mine. Honestly, this range of voltages is undefined and results in an invalid state, often referred to as floating.

Given the particularities of microcontrollers (limited number of IO ports, memory and processing speed), certain types of communication protocols are preferred. Below we show a couple of general characteristics present in different protocols:</p> <p>Serial Communication with Microcontrollers | Microcontroller Tutorials (teachmemicro.com)</p> <p>Serial communication is the process of transmitting data one bit at a time. In contrast, parallel communication is where data bits are sent as a whole. Parallel data transmission is faster than serial transmission but with a number of disadvantages:</p> <ul> <li>It needs more wires and therefore can be more expensive to implement</li> <li>The greater number of wires limit it to shorter transmission distances</li> <li>It is susceptible to clock skew, which limits the speed of transmission to the slowest of the links</li> <li>Crosstalk is also an issue due to the proximity of the wires</li> </ul> <p>Serial data transmission answers all the above problems, most especially the first one, as cost and limited pins are common issues in microcontroller system design.</p> <p>There are generally two types of serial transmission: asynchronous and synchronous which literally means \u201cnot synced\u201d and \u201csynced\u201d respectively. In asynchronous data transfer, there is no clock signal for transmission and reception. The common UART (also known as RS-232 or SCI) is a device found in microcontrollers for asynchronous communication (using the serial protocol, see below - this device is also found on cars and mobile phones). There are also devices for synchronous communication, where  an extra line is added for the clock (synchronising) signal. </p> <p>The clock signal ensures that reception of correct data bits. </p> <p>For the rest of the course, serial will now refer to asynchronous data transmission used by UART devices found in Arduino and PIC microcontrollers. For the current course we won\u2019t go into details about synchronous data transmission protocols and we refer these articles with more information about them: SPI, I2C.</p>"},{"location":"courses/intro_to_electronics/#the-serial-protocol","title":"The Serial Protocol","text":"<p>Serial communication follows a simple protocol (rules to follow) to ensure correct transmission. A serial data consists of</p> <ul> <li>Data Bits</li> <li>Synchronization Bits</li> <li>Parity Bits</li> </ul> <p>The added overhead that was referred to are the synchronization (or sync) and parity bits. The sync bits are start and stop bits to indicate the start and end of transmission. When the serial bus (or data line) is idle, the voltage level goes high. The sending device sends a logic 0 (the start bit) to kickstart the transmission.</p> <p>Data bits ranging from 5 to 9 bits then follow. The order of data bits is from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).</p> <p>The transmission of the parity bit, used for error checking, follows. Parity can either be even or odd. For even parity, the parity bit makes the number of 1\u2019s even. For odd parity, the parity bit makes the number of 1\u2019s odd.</p> <p>Example: The data bits 1010001 have three 1\u2019s. For even parity, the parity bit should be 1 to make the total number of 1\u2019s equal to 4 (an even number).

What Is MicroPython? - Programming with MicroPython [Book] (oreilly.com)</p> <p>MicroPython is a full reimplementation of Python 3. Apart from some differences described in the coming paragraphs, what you know about Python also applies to MicroPython. The most obvious difference between regular Python and Micro\u00adPython is that MicroPython is designed to work under extraordinarily constrained conditions (such as just 16 kilobytes of RAM on some of the microcontrollers (eg the micro:bit).</p> <p>MicroPython runs \u201cbare-metal\u201d directly on the hardware: there is no underlying operating system like Windows, macOS, or Linux. All the operations and services usually provided by an operating system are handled directly by MicroPython. MicroPython has complete and direct control of the hardware, so, in effect, Micro\u00adPython is the operating system. Apart from a few exceptions, all of the language features of Python are also in MicroPython. </p> <p>Due to the limited resources in the devices, MicroPython does not come with the full standard library by default. Rather, depending on the device, it will come with a subset of the standard library, often reimplemented in an efficient embedded-friendly manner.5 Usually, most of the features of a module will be available, but aspects that are considered edge-cases or redundant in an embedded context will not be implemented. All versions of MicroPython come with modules for interacting with the hardware, GPIO (general-purpose input/output) pins, peripherals, and components connected via such pins.</p> <p>Since MicroPython is Python 3, you get:</p> <ul> <li>Python\u2019s style of object orientation </li> <li>Data types (like unicode strings, integers, and floating-point numbers) and data structures (like lists, sets, and dictionaries)</li> <li>The highly dynamic nature of Python objects</li> <li>Functions as first-class objects</li> <li>Exception handling (try, except, finally, and the standard built-in exception classes)</li> <li>Fun features like generator functions (using the yield keyword), generator expressions, and list comprehensions</li> <li>The new async and await keywords in the very latest versions of MicroPython</li> <li>A comprehensive number of Python\u2019s built-in functions</li> </ul> <p>Because MicroPython runs on devices with different capabilities, the availability of features and modules will sometimes be different. Of course, devices with special capabilities, like WiFi, will include modules to support these features.</p> <p>For example, the micro:bit comes with a cut-down version of the standard library\u2019s random module, but the default build for the ESP8266 board has the ultra minimalist urandom module 6 instead. Because of the onboard WiFi capability, the ESP8266 port comes with both the json and urequests modules, whereas the micro:bit port does not because the micro:bit has no WiFi. MicroPython on both boards comes with the universally useful math module.</p> <p>MicroPython\u2019s comprehensive and flexible re-implementation of Python 3 raises three interesting opportunities:</p> <ol> <li>The wider Python community has the opportunity to try embedded development using their favourite language.</li> <li>Embedded developers who use C and other traditional embedded languages have the opportunity to take advantage of Python\u2019s ease of use and rich libraries.</li> <li>Beginner programmers have the opportunity to start with more than just \u201cHello, World!\u201d They\u2019re empowered to create engaging first projects using light, sound, sensors, and networking.</li> </ol> <p>In the next section we will start showing some examples on how certain structures in programming works and how we can take advantage of them to perform complex tasks  </p>"},{"location":"courses/intro_to_electronics/#if-else-statement-and-its-python-implementation","title":"If-else statement and its Python implementation","text":"<p>Python if, if...else, if...elif...else and Nested if Statement (programiz.com)</p> <p>Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied.

These types of signals can come from sound, light, temperature and motion. Digital signals are represented by a sequence of discrete values where the signal is broken down into sequences that depend on the time series or sampling rate (more on this later). The easiest way to explain this is through a visual! The Figure below shows a great example of what analog and digital signals look like.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure: A continuous signal (analog) turning into a digital signal. (Source: Waqas Akram \u2013 Quantization in ADCs)</p> <p>Microcontrollers can\u2019t read values unless it\u2019s digital data. This is because microcontrollers can only see \u201clevels\u201d of the voltage, which depends on the resolution of the ADC and the system voltage.</p> <p>ADCs follow a sequence when converting analog signals to digital. They first sample the signal, then quantify it to determine the resolution of the signal, and finally set binary values and send it to the system to read the digital signal. Two important aspects of the ADC are its sampling rate and resolution.</p>"},{"location":"courses/intro_to_electronics/#sampling-ratefrequency","title":"Sampling Rate/Frequency","text":"<p>The ADC\u2019s sampling rate, also known as sampling frequency, can be tied to the ADC\u2019s speed. The sampling rate is measured by using \u201csamples per second\u201d, where the units are in SPS or S/s (or if you\u2019re using sampling frequency, it would be in Hz). This simply means how many samples or data points it takes within a second. The more samples the ADC takes, the higher frequencies it can handle.</p> <p>One important equation on the sample rate is:</p> <p>$$ fs = {1 \\over T} $$</p> <p>Where,</p> <p>$$ fs = {Sample Rate \\over Frequency} $$</p> <p>T = Period of the sample or the time it takes before sampling again</p> <p>For example, in Figure 1, it seems fs is 20 S/s (or 20 Hz), while T is 50 ms. The sample rate is very slow, but the signal still came out similar to the original analog signal. This is because the frequency of the original signal is a slow 1 Hz, meaning the frequency rate was still good enough to reconstruct a similar signal.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens when the sampling rate is considerably slower?\u201d you might ask. It is important to know the sampling rate of the ADC because you will need to know if it will cause aliasing. Aliasing means that when a digital image/signal is reconstructed, it differs greatly from the original image/signal caused from sampling.</p> <p>If the sampling rate is slow and the frequency of the signal is high, the ADC will not be able to reconstruct the original analog signal which will cause the system to read incorrect data. A good example is shown in Figure 2.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure: An example of how aliasing happens. (Source: Tony R. Kuphaldt - Lessons in Electric Circuits)</p> <p>In this example, you can see where the sampling occurs in the analog input signal. The output of the digital signal is not at all close to the original signal as the sampling rate is not high enough to keep up with the analog signal. This causes aliasing and now the digital system will be missing the full picture of the analog signal.</p> <p>One rule of thumb when figuring out if aliasing will happen is using Nyquist Theorem. According to the theorem, the sampling rate/frequency needs to be at least twice as much as the highest frequency in the signal to recreate the original analog signal. The following equation is used to find the Nyquist frequency:</p> <p>$$ fNyquist = 2fMax $$</p> <p>Where,</p> <p>$$ fNyquist = Nyquist frequency $$</p> <p>fMax = The max frequency that appears in the signal</p> <p>For example, if the signal that you input into the digital system has a max frequency of 100 kHz, then the sampling rate on your ADC needs to be equal or greater than 200 kS/s. This will allow for a successful reconstruction of the original signal.</p> <p>It is also good to note that there are cases where outside noise can introduce unexpected high frequency into the analog signal, which can disrupt the signal because the sample rate couldn\u2019t handle the added noise frequency. It is always a good idea to add an anti-aliasing filter (low-pass filter) before the ADC and sampling begins, as it can prevent unexpected high frequencies to make it to the system.</p>"},{"location":"courses/intro_to_electronics/#resolution-of-adc","title":"Resolution of ADC","text":"<p>The ADC\u2019s resolution can be tied to the precision of the ADC.

(Source: Apple Inc \u2013 Soundtrack Pro 3: Audio Fundamentals)</p> <p>If you need accurate voltage level for your system to read, then the bit resolution is important to know.

At the heart of the counter is a special purpose register that stores the current value of the counter. Any time that a certain event occurs, the value of this counter is incremented (+1 is added to the value). The type of event that causes this increment is typically configurable through other special purpose registers. Because the counter value is stored in a special purpose register, this implies that the value can also be read from or written to by the executing code. Also, different counters will store values of different sizes. The typical sizes for 8-bit microcontrollers, such as the Atmel MegaX line, are 8 and 16 bits (1 and 2 bytes). Because of this finite size, the counter can only count to a maximum value (255 for an 8-bit counter, and 65535 for a 16-bit counter). Once the counter reaches this maximum value, and a new event occurs, the counter resets back to zero. From here, the counter continues to increment with each event</p> <p>In addition to counting external events, it is possible to also count events that are internal to the processor. In particular, by using the system clock (or a derivative thereof), the counter can be incremented at regular intervals. In this form, the counter becomes a form of timer. Often, the system clock is running at some \u201chigh\u201d frequency (e.g., in our microcontrollers, we might see clocks of 16 MHz or 20 MHz). However, it is often the case that we may want our timer to count at much slower rates. This is handled in microcontrollers through the use of hardware prescalers that divide the system clock down to some reasonable frequency. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the system clock, the prescaler and the counter value. Prescalers are implemented as counters in and of themselves. Recall that if some counter is being incremented at a regular frequency, f, then bit 0 of the counter is exhibiting a regular signal at a frequency of f/2. Furthermore, bit 1 has a frequency of f/4. By \u201ctapping into\u201d the prescaler counter at different bits, we can divide the system clock by a range of different divisors (where the divisor takes a form of 2<sup>i</sup> for some i).</p> <p>We would now like to answer questions involving the rate at which our counter is counting or the amount of time that a certain number of counts will take. In order to talk about these ideas, we first must be able to distinguish between cycles/second of the main system clock and of the prescaled signal. Here, we have artificially defined the unit of a \u201ctick\u201d as a single cycle of the system clock and \u201ctock\u201d as a single cycle of the prescaled signal. Hence, we can express prescaler values in terms of ticks per tock, i.e, how many system clock cycles compose a single prescaled cycle. Example: assume a system clock of 16, 000, 000 ticks/sec and a prescaler of 64 ticks/tock.

If you would like to add information about time to each data collected, plus identify from which system the data has been collected, you would need another ~5 bytes. So every data point would be 7 bytes of information. Considering most applications will have several streams of data (temperature, humidity, triggering time of events, other sensors), and that we still have to factor in the code we write and upload to the board, this can consume all the space available in no time.

Therefore in one second we can theoretically transmit ~2000 data points for temperature readings (in reality this is less as the device needs to spend time opening the communication port, sending the data, sending other check bits, etc).
