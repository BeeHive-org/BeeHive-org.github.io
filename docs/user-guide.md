## Soldering

### The board
Before we begin, we need to familiarize ourselves with the board. Have a good look at the component IDs and where they go on the board. In general, we will start soldering loose parts to the board first, beginning with the lowest/shortest.

### Tips and tricks

1. JST connectors 
	1. Orientation: Make sure they fit the footprint.
2. Female headers
3. 

### Orientation of components
Two of the capacitors, C1 and C2, have a white stripe


# Notes
On the board, have either a separate colour or something to denote the ID of a component. E.g. a colour for when we solder, something separate from what we need when we use the board.

Do the ID letters have a meaning? Could we use a random letter so we could solder them in alphabetical order, e.g. A1, A2,... A14, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, E1?

Capacitors, resistors, transistors, FET, inductors

We need to have up-to-date models on the repo.

## Driver board & High power switch array
Resistor footprints are not the right size, too big for 1000ohm, too small for 47ohm.
