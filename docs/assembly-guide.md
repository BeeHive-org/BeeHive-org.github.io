## Knowledge base
To fully assemble the BeeHive system, it is important to go through the basics of soldering and the required tools to do so. [A handy sparkfun tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering/all) is a very good place to start although the particular tools and consumables are left to user's discretion.

## Tools
